# EmailFromCSV
Reads a .CSV file (non-formatted excel sheet) and exports every instance of an email to a new .CSV file. The primary use of this application was to export emails from an excel sheet full of client information; any instance of a "word" with an '@' symbol AND a '.' symbol was exported to a new file.
